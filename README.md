Going through Hello-World Guide

Hi World.  This is my very first time using Git, so I am going through the very basic guide
to learn the process of using git at the company i work at.  So far, I understand everything
and it all makes sense to me.  THATS GREAT!!!! Like Tony the Tiger says in the cereal comercial :).
